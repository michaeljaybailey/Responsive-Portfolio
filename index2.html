      <p>
        Hi, I'm Michael. 
        I’m a knowledge-seeking, full-stack web-development student eager to put my problem solving and analytical skills to use in creating visually and functionally effective web apps.</p> 
        <p>
        In my previous experience in customer service and management, I gained invaluable experience both leading and working in a team, as displayed in the classroom and through my projects, viewable on GitHub. </p>

       <p>I am currently a web development student in UCLA’s 6-month coding bootcamp. During this time, I’ve continuously engaged myself with my peers and mentors to unravel and re-wire the challenges of front-end and back-end web development. </p>
        <p>
        Check out some of my most recent projects and skills above. 

        You can contact me through email, my LinkedIn, or my Github page!
